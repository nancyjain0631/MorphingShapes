# Morphing Shapes
This is a learning project

This repo has two projects

## Project 1
I have used Canvas and KeyframeAnimator API to define the radius values for the morphing effect

Interactions: 

* Back button: go to previous page
* Skip button: go to last page
* Continue button: go to next page
* Indicators to show current page
